## Description 

The main objective of this project is to construct a robust and dynamic API for a social networking web application using `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, and `Mongoose`. This allows one to build a solid data foundation -- undoubtedly the cornerstone of full-stack applications. 

The challenge here is to understand how to build and structure the API first, efficiently handling functionalities such as enabling users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list.

The user data, thoughts, and reactions in this project draw inspiration from the beloved characters of the Harry Potter series.
